# worldstrands

This repository contains a prototype Unity tool for generating stylized ropes with prayer flags. The initial implementation includes a `WorldStrandProfile` ScriptableObject and its custom Inspector UI. This profile defines the vertical cross‑section of a strand with positions and per‑vertex colors.

Scripts are located under `Assets/WorldStrands/`.
